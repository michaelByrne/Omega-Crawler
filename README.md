# Omega-Crawler
A from-scratch web crawler based on Python backend, PHP middleware, and JS-based visualization.

This is the application that the TreespaceJS package was created for. It's a web crawler built from scratch using Python and a bit of PHP. It lets users set a maximum crawl depth, a traversal method (DFS or BFS), and a terminating search term. There's no BS4 or anything under the hood, just urllib2 and the regex lib. I'd refactor it into something that could more properly be published, but eh, it's probably not worth it. It's too nice out.
